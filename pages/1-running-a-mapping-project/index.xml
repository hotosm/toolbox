      <description>Overview In this section, Project Managers will find guides, tools and resources to design a mapping project including:
 Considerations and question guides for determining project factors such as scope, scale, and logistics; Resources for selecting hardware; Guides and materials for planning workshops/trainings.    1.1 Defining Needs and Requirements poses questions to answer when defining the scope of the project, such as purpose, geographic scale, and what features to map, as well as ensuring that the project takes into account the various contexts and stakeholders involved in the project.</description>

      <description>Course Objectives This section includes guiding questions and considerations that Project Managers and OSM communities should take into account when beginning a project, by the end of this section, you should be able to:
 Understand factors to consider when deciding needs and requirement Learn how to build the team Learn how to collaborate with community   Learning Activities When starting a mapping project, it is important to define the scope of the project and understand the larger context in which the data is needed, this includes understanding how to work with local stakeholders and how the data will impact them.</description>

      <description>Course Objectives In this section, Project Managers will find considerations for assessing the needs for safety and security for field operations. As a project manager, you should be able to:
 Understand the topics to consider when discussing security plans   Learning Activities Safety and Security In accordance with the first protection principle – do no harm – organizations must prioritize safety, especially of refugee populations. In non-camp situations one of the key goals is expanding the amount of protection space available.</description>
