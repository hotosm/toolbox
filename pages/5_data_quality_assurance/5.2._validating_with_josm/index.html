<h3 id="overview-of-validation">Overview of Validation</h3>
<p><strong>Validation</strong> is a process of checking the data quality (in this case, map data quality) for accuracy, consistency, completeness and anomaly. Validation is important to maintain the quality of OSM data. There are lots of aspects that we need to consider during validation, namely accuracy, consistency, completeness, and anomaly detection.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/5_quality_assurance/03_validating_with_josm/050301_validation_using_josm.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>When checking for accuracy</strong>, you need to make sure that the map data is aligned with the imagery and is correct in terms of geometry.</p>
<p><strong>For consistency</strong>, make sure that all mapped objects are consistent in shape. For example, when you found a residential area, make sure all the buildings are consistently traced and orthogonalized.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/5_quality_assurance/03_validating_with_josm/050302_accurately_consistently_mapped_buildings.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>For completeness</strong>, it depends on what information you want to collect when mapping and what mapping method is used. Information collected using remote mapping method would be different with the information collected by conducting field survey. Information collected using remote mapping method will be very limited since you only have satellite imagery and gpx tracks available as reference.</p>
<p><strong>For anomaly</strong>, make sure there is no abnormal looking mapped objects. This can be acquired by checking the OSM data with visual checks and compare with your preferred imagery.</p>
<p>While light validation can be completed using iD Editor, HOT recommends that detailed validation be completed using JOSM.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Estimated time for completion</strong>: 1 hour</p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>To be able to understand validation process for OSM data</li>
<li>To be able to perform validation using Validation Tools on JOSM</li>
<li>To be able to fix commonly error, warning and mistake found during validation</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1-opening-osm-data">1. Opening OSM Data</h4>
<p>After successfully downloaded sample data, open file validation_sample.osm into your JOSM by following these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click menu <strong>File</strong> ➝ <strong>Open</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../../images/5_quality_assurance/03_validating_with_josm/050304_open.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>Go to your directory where you save validation_sample.osm. Select the file <strong>validation_sample.osm</strong> and then click <strong>Open</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../../images/5_quality_assurance/03_validating_with_josm/050305_open(1).png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>After opening the exercise file, your JOSM will look like this:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../../images/5_quality_assurance/03_validating_with_josm/050306_exercise_file.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="2-using-josm-validation-tools">2. Using JOSM Validation Tools</h4>
<p>JOSM provides a built-in validator that checks and fixes invalid map data called Validation Tools. After checking for accuracy, consistency, completeness and anomaly, run this validation tools so that the map data is perfectly valid. To get started with the Validation tools, you need to activate the Validation Results Windows by following these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click menu <strong>Windows</strong> ➝ <strong>Validation Results</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../../images/5_quality_assurance/03_validating_with_josm/050307_validation_results.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>Validation results Windows will appear on the left side of your JOSM</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../../images/5_quality_assurance/03_validating_with_josm/050308_validation_results(1).png" alt=""></p>
<p>After activating the Validation Results Windows, now you can start validation using JOSM Validation Tools. Download OSM data first using either Slippy Map or Tasking Mananger, then you can click the Validation button in the Validation Results Windows. Let’s use <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13QgUDeoBA7uLSUkjsK8cEFsadmjpbNg_/view">OSM data sample</a> for exercise.</p>
<ul>
<li>To run validation on all the data in the current data layer, which is validation_sample.osm, make sure that there is no data selected. Then, click **Validation **button in the Validation Results Windows. Once the validation process is finished, Validation Results Windows will be filled with listed errors and warnings. The amount of errors and warnings found depends on the quality of the data. For example, on this OSM data sample, you will find one error and twenty one warnings.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../../images/5_quality_assurance/03_validating_with_josm/050309_validation_results(2).png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>A new layer called Validation errors will also be added to the Layers Windows. This layer will highlight the errors and warnings found - red highlight for errors and yellow highlight for warnings.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../../images/5_quality_assurance/03_validating_with_josm/050310_validation_results(3).png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="3-fixing-errors-and-warnings">3. Fixing Errors and Warnings</h4>
<p>Errors are important to fix. <strong>Do not ignore errors</strong>. If you have errors on your OSM data, you won’t be able to upload it into OSM Server until you fix the errors. Some errors can be fixed automatically using the Fix button on Validation Results Windows.</p>
<p>Warnings are problems that are important to fix, but in some cases, such as “Unnamed Ways”, they are tolerable. Mostly, warning should be fixed manually. Now, let’s try to fix errors and warnings found on validation_sample.osm. There are one error and twenty one warnings found on <em>validation_sample.osm</em>. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Error: Duplicated ways (1)</li>
<li>Warning: Building inside building (4)</li>
<li>Warning: Crossing building/highway (1)</li>
<li>Warning: Crossing buildings (1)</li>
<li>Warning: Crossing highways (1)</li>
<li>Warning: deprecated tagging - amenity=hotel is deprecated, use tourism=hotel instead (1)</li>
<li>Warning: missing tag - incomplete object: only name (1)</li>
<li>Warning: node connects highway and building (1)</li>
<li>Warning: Overlapping highways (1)</li>
<li>Warning: Unclosed way - building (1)</li>
<li>Warning: Unnamed ways (6)</li>
<li>Warning: Untagged ways (1)</li>
<li>Warning: Way end node near other highway (2)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let’s fix all the errors and warnings one by one.</p>
<h4 id="31-fixing-error-duplicated-ways">3.1 Fixing Error: Duplicated ways</h4>
<p>Duplicated ways error come up when there are ways that duplicate. This is usually caused by unstable internet connection when uploading OSM data into OSM server. Initially, to fix errors or warning, you should select the error or warning you want to fix. Go to the Duplicated ways error in the Validation Result Windows, click the + icon so that it looks like the picture below.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/5_quality_assurance/03_validating_with_josm/050311_fixing_error.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Review the error and warnings and its corresponding solution. Identify which of the issues the passage is referring to:</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<p>This warning is the most commonly found warning during validation. Most OpenStreetMap users digitize two buildings too closely to the point that they might be sharing a line or even overlapping with each other. To fix this warning, you just need to move or delete one of the overlapping buildings.</p>
<p>a. Building Duplicated Nodes</p>
<p>b. Unnamed ways</p>
<p>c. Crossing Building</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This warning comes up when there are two lines or highway objects overlapping without an intersection node between those lines or highway. To fix this warning, you just need to add an intersection node between those lines/highway.</p>
<p>a. Crossing Ways</p>
<p>b. Unnamed ways</p>
<p>c. Crossing Building</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It shows that there is a way or road without a name on it. If you know the name of the street, then you have to update it. However, for most cases, you can just ignore this warning if you do not know the place. Most mappers who do their mapping remotely do not usually have local knowledge to know the names of the roads.</p>
