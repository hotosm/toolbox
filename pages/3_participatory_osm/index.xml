      <description>Course Objectives This section provides:
 An overview of data conflict in OpenStreetMap Step-by-step instructions for resolving data conflict in JOSM Guidance on preventing and managing data conflict   Learning Activities Other contributors may have edited the same features as you in JOSM.
