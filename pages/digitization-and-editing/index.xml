      <description>In this section, Project Managers will find tools and resources to lead and implement organized OpenStreetMap editing activities including:
 Presentations and step-by-step guides for introducing teams to OpenStreetMap and editing tools such as the HOT Tasking Manager.
 Resources for determining if your project needs to meet OSM Organized Editing Guidelines Detailed guides and training activities for digitization teams to use during validation and data upload  Digitization, or remote mapping, is the process of tracing features such as buildings and roads from aerial or satellite imagery to create map data.</description>

Overview Before starting any mapping project, it is important to assess, and if necessary, update the OpenStreetMap basemap through remote mapping. This remote mapping process helps ensure that the buildings and roads used during a field mapping phase are up to date, improving the quality and effectiveness of field mapping efforts.</description>

      <title>3.5 Validating with JOSM</title>

      <guid>/pages/digitization-and-editing/3.5_validating_with_josm/</guid>
      <description>Overview Validation is a process of checking the data quality (in this case, map data quality) for accuracy, consistency, completeness and anomaly. Validation is important to maintain the quality of OSM data. When checking for accuracy, you need to make sure that the map data is aligned with the imagery and is correct in terms of geometry. For consistency, make sure that all mapped objects are consistent in shape. For example, when you found a residential area, make sure all the buildings are consistently traced and orthogonalized.</description>

      <title>3.6 Resolving conflicts in JOSM</title>
      <link>/pages/digitization-and-editing/3.6-data-conflict-in-josm/</link>

      <guid>/pages/digitization-and-editing/3.6-data-conflict-in-josm/</guid>
      <description>Objectives:
 Participants can explain what is data conflict on OpenStreetMap Participants knowing about types of conflict in JOSM Participants can fix data conflicts using JOSM Participants know to avoid data conflict in JOSM  When you are uploading your changes in JSOM, some contributors might also do editing in your area. This might occur data conflict in your uploading process. Therefore, in this module, you will learn about data conflict in OpenStreetMap, types of conflict, and how to fix it using JOSM.</description>
