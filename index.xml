      <description>Overview In this section, Project Managers will find example use case from HOT projects on how the processes, tools, and workflows contained in previous sections of this Toolbox have been applied to real field projects. Project Managers can use these example workflows to identify a project similar in scope or goal to their own and identify which tools and processes may be needed for their own project. Each workflow example contains:</description>

      <title>How to use the HOT Toolbox</title>
      <link>/pages/introduction/how_to_use_toolbox/</link>

      <guid>/pages/introduction/how_to_use_toolbox/</guid>
      <description>The HOT Toolbox is designed to take a project manager or community through the entire mapping workflow, from planning, through initial mapping, data use and analysis. Not every mapping project is the same. Some projects involve extensive field data collection components, others might not even conduct field mapping activities but run desktop-based digitization projects instead.
The Toolbox has seven sections (overview below) that can be used in the order presented, or combined to suit your individual project training needs.</description>
