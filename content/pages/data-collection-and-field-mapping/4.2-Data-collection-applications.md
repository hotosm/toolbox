## Overview 
Several mobile applications exist to assist with field data collection. Choosing an application to use depends on mobile device capability, varying set-up requirements, and survey needs. Options include [OpenDataKit](https://opendatakit.org/), [OpenMapKit](http://openmapkit.org/), [KoboCollect](https://www.kobotoolbox.org), [OSMTracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmtracker&hl=en_US), and [Maps.me](https://maps.me/)<br><br>

Which data collection application should I use?

## 1. Open Data Kit (ODK) 
ODK is a free an open-source set of tools which help organizations author, field, and manage mobile data collection solutions. ODK Collect is part of ODK and is an Android app that replaces paper forms used in survey-based data gathering. It supports a wide range of question and answer types, and is designed to work well without network connectivity.



**Skills and Technology Needed**

* Computer
* Internet Connection
* Mobile devices (see [Hardware](https://hotosm.github.io/toolbox/pages/running-a-mapping-project/1.5-hardware/) for specifications.) 
* [ODK forms](https://hotosm.github.io/toolbox/pages/data-collection-and-field-mapping/4.4-creating-forms-odk-omk/)
* Spreadsheet software (such as Excel or [LibreCalc](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/))

**Use OpenDataKit (ODK) if:**
  * You have access to mobile devices but they have limited RAM & storage
  * You do not need to collect data for buildings in OSM OR you are able to manually transfer data collected as points to OSM polygons after data collection. 
  * You want or need to have an easy set-up option for data collection.

**Resources**

* OpenDataKit: https://opendatakit.org
* ODK Guide: https://docs.opendatakit.org/collect-intro
* ODK Build: https://build.opendatakit.org
* Building ODK Forms: http://xlsform.org/en

**Download**

* Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.odk.collect.android&hl=en_US

**Set-up**

1. Create ODK forms
2. Add ODK forms to mobile data collection devices. See [Device and Tools Set-up and Testing](https://hotosm.github.io/toolbox/pages/running-a-mapping-project/1.5.1-setting-up-phones-and-servers/)

## 2. OpenMapKit (OMK) 

OMK is an extension that launches directly from within ODK Collect when the OSM question type is enabled in a standard survey. It is what allows you to browse OSM features, and to create and edit OSM tags. 



**Skills and Technology Needed**

* Computer
* Internet Connection
* Mobile devices (see [Hardware](https://hotosm.github.io/toolbox/pages/running-a-mapping-project/1.5-hardware/) for specifications.) 
* [OMK forms](https://github.com/hotosm/toolbox/wiki/4.3-Creating-forms-(ODK-OMK))
* Spreadsheet software (such as Excel or [LibreCalc](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/))
* Additional files
  * [.mbtiles](https://github.com/hotosm/toolbox/wiki/4.5-Creating-.mbtiles)
  * OSM layer
  * Constraint file
* Recommended: Server

**Use OpenMapKit (OMK) if:** 
  * You have access to mobile devices with sufficient RAM & storage (see [Hardware](https://github.com/hotosm/toolbox/wiki/1.5-Hardware) for specifications.) 
  * You need to collect data for buildings in OSM
  * You have the capacity for more intensive set-up prior to data collection

**Resources**

* OpenMapKit: http://openmapkit.org

**Download**

* Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.redcross.openmapkit&hl=en_US

**Set-up**

1. Create OMK forms
2. Create .mbtiles
3. Create .osm layer
4. Create constraint file
1. [Download and set up ODK and OMK applications.](https://hotosm.github.io/toolbox/pages/running-a-mapping-project/1.5.1-setting-up-phones-and-servers/)

## 3. KoBoCollect
Kobo is in almost all ways similar to ODK Collect, and is built on top of the ODK platform. Kobo also has prebuilt analysis tools and is another popular option. 

**Skills and Technology Needed:**

* Computer
* Internet Connection
* Kobo Account
* Mobile devices (see [Hardware](https://hotosm.github.io/toolbox/pages/running-a-mapping-project/1.5-hardware/) for specifications.) 

**Resources**

* UNHCR instance of KoBo Collect: https://kobo.unhcr.org/
* OCHA instance of Kobo Collect: https://kobo.humanitarianresponse.info/

**Download**

* Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.koboc.collect.android&hl=en_US

## 4. Maps.Me
Maps.me is a navigation application that uses OpenStreetMap data, and can be used offline. It is suitable for collection Point of Interest (POI) information, as far as these fit within the types of data that Maps.me shows you on the map.

**Skills and Technology Needed**

* Internet Connection (for application download)
* Mobile devices (see [Hardware](https://hotosm.github.io/toolbox/pages/running-a-mapping-project/1.5-hardware/) for specifications.) 
* Android or iOS device

**Resources**

* Maps.me: https://maps.me
* OSM Wiki: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/MAPS.ME

**Download**

* Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapswithme.maps.pro&hl=en_US

## 5. OSMTracker
OSM Tracker is “an offline GPS tracker designed for collecting points of interest (POI) to be added to the map and for recording GPX tracks.” OSM Tracker is free and open-source.

**Skills and Technology Needed**

* Internet Connection (for application download)
* Mobile devices (see [Hardware](https://hotosm.github.io/toolbox/pages/running-a-mapping-project/1.5-hardware/) for specifications.)
