title : 5.1.1 Server Data
---
Server data in this case refers to data sent to a server from the field. This data then has to be downloaded from the server, in order to prepare it for cleaning and validation. We will take for example data collected during the [NMP Building Validation Project](https://www.hotosm.org/projects/botswana-field-data-collection-to-support-the-national-malaria-programme/) in Botswana. Servers used can be:

* A local Portable OpenStreetMap Server - **POSM** (for both **ODK** and **OMK** data)
* An online OpenMapKit Server (for both **ODK** and **OMK** data)
* KoboToolbox (for only **ODK** data)
