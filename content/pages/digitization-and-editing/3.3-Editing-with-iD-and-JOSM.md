title : 3.3 Editing with iD and JOSM
---
There are several ways to edit in OpenStreetMap. The two most commonly used tools and best programs for mapping projects are iD editor and JOSM.

**iD Editor**

The iD editor is a user-friendly tool that allows you to directly make changes in OpenStreetMap.
iD is good for:

* Simple edits
* Fast Internet access to load the imagery and save the edits.
* Following a consistent and simple tagging scheme.
* When you are restricted from installing a program on the computer you are using.

Skills and Technology Needed:

* Computer
* Strong Internet connection
* OSM account


**Java OpenStreetMap Editor (JOSM)**  
JOSM (Java OpenStreetMap Editor) is an open source editor for OpenStreetMap data. JOSM is best for:

* Adding many buildings (See buildings_tool plugin).
* Editing many polygons or lines that already exist.
* When you are on an unreliable Internet connection or offline.
* Using a specific tagging scheme (or custom presets).
