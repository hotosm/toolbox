Effective Field Mapping Management - knowing when, where, and what data is collected by each team member - is critical to ensuring that mapping efforts are done in a timely and safe manner with high quality and completeness. Additionally, field supervisors and team members will need the skills to set-up and manage field data collection tools. This section provides guides for setting up and using three tools: OpenDataKit, OpenMapKit, and OSMTracker.

* [Using FMTM for Field Data Collection](https://toolbox.hotosm.org/pages/4_field-mapping-management/4_2_using_fmtm_for_field_data_collection/) provides explanation on how to use FMTM within ODK Collect.
* [Using ODK Collect](https://toolbox.hotosm.org/pages/4_field-mapping-management/4_3_using_odk_collect/) serves as a step-by-step guide for surveyors, mappers, and field surveyors to set up and use ODK Collect.
