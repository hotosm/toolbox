**Data Cleaning, Upload, and Quality Assurance** is a critical step in any mapping workflow. This process covers cleaning raw field data for errors and mistakes, uploading clean data to OpenStreetMap, and using various quality control tools to monitor data that has been uploaded. Regardless of how (and if) you are collecting field data, any project that results edits in OpenStreetMap should have a quality assurance and control plan.

* [Quality Assurance Tools](https://toolbox.hotosm.org/pages/5_data_quality_assurance/5.1._quality_assurance_and_quality_control_tools/) provides a guide to tools HOT uses for monitoring and checking data quality of data uploaded to OpenStreetMap.
