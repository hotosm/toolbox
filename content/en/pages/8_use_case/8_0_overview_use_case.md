## Overview

In this section, Project Managers will find example use case from HOT projects on how the processes, tools, and workflows contained in previous sections of this Toolbox have been applied to real field projects. Project Managers can use these example workflows to identify a project similar in scope or goal to their own and identify which tools and processes may be needed for their own project. Each workflow example contains:

* An overview of the project
* A step-by-step guide of phases, steps, and tools used
* Links to various parts of the Toolbox to learn how the step was completed

There are many ways to complete a mapping project. HOT has provided overviews of how weâ€™ve completed projects with the following workflows:

* [Mapping POI with ODK + KoboToolbox Server](https://toolbox.hotosm.org/pages/8_use_case/8_1_mapping_poi_with_odk_kobo/) showcases the tools and processes used in a simple field mapping project used by a local NGO to integrate into existing programs using OpenDataKit and KoboToolBox Server.
* [Post-Earthquake Building Damage Assessment using OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://toolbox.hotosm.org/pages/8_use_case/8_2_post_earthquake/) explain the step-by-step process for conduct building damage assessment with OSM.
